# PinkPulse
### My seed fund-backed little adventure 

### Overview
PinkPulse is an innovative womenâ€™s healthcare platform that provides online consultation and networking services across Asia. Our vision is to create an optimized two-sided marketplace where health professionals and female patients can seamlessly connect. By turning data into proactive healthcare, PinkPulse aims to address several critical issues: raising public awareness about womenâ€™s health, empowering and educating the womenâ€™s community, and strengthening the healthcare network. We tackle problems like low awareness and cognition in womenâ€™s health, lack of early disease detection and prevention, user disempowerment over healthcare, and the presence of healthcare upcoding. With features like upcoding detection, AI-powered disease recognition, and a robust healthcare algorithm, PinkPulse is dedicated to transforming how women manage their health.
